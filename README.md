Ever wonder where the next affordable cancer drug could come from? Who is on the threshold of a breakthrough in HIV/AIDS cure? Going by the data, even a handful of research centers across New York can be at the forefront of curing life-threatening diseases. The project ‘Where is your cure?’ probes into the various medical research centers working on cures, their funding and people who channel the resources. 
Our project takes a look at the various research and medical centers in the New York area, which Universities are they affiliated to, what work are they doing in research and how much money is pumped into them. It tries to find answers to who are the pharmaceutical companies sponsoring the studies and what drugs are they interested in testing. 
But most importantly, when we pursued the journalistic adage of ‘follow the money’, we almost always stumbled upon the Principal Investigator or the PI.
While investigating our dataset we found that the PI is one of the most powerful person when it came to the allocation of research funds. These PIs, leading the research teams are the main players who act as the bridge between big pharma and medical researchers. We made the connection between the PIs, research centers and pharma.   
Parsing the dataset was tough, as it was rich and exhaustive. We decided to narrow down the focus and concentrate solely on the New York area. That helped us in forming a counter narrative to the obvious angles the larger dataset led us to. It also backed us in constructing a comparatively strong journalistic structure and report.
